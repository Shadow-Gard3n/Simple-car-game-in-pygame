# Khel

A simple road racing game built using Pygame. The player controls a car and avoids colliding with an oncoming vehicle. Try to survive as long as possible and get the highest score!


## Features
- Two cars on the road: the player's car and an obstacle car.
- Randomized car spawn positions.
- Moving trees for added visual interest.
- Restart option when the game ends.
- Score counter displayed in real-time.

## How to Play
- Use the **left** and **right** arrow keys to control the car's movement.
- Avoid colliding with the oncoming car.
- Your score increases with each obstacle avoided.
- If you collide, the game will end, and you'll have the option to restart by clicking the **RESTART** button.

## Game Over Conditions
The game ends when your car collides with the obstacle car. The screen will display "GAME OVER" along with a restart button to try again.

## Installation
